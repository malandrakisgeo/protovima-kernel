My first step in kernel programming. More of a playground than an actual project.

Goal: a kernel providing a shell with some basic commands. 

Supposed to run on any single-core CPU with an i386 architecture.

DISCLAIMER: C is not my cup of tea, so be prepared for some weird code here.

==========================

Bootloader&Makefile largely based on::
