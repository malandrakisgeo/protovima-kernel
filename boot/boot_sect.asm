; A boot sector that boots from 16-bits mode into 32-bit protected mode and load a C kernel

; When we reboot our computer, it doesn't have any notion of an operating system.
; Luckily, we do have the Basic Input/Output Software (BIOS), 
; a collection of software routines that are initially loaded from a chip into memory 
; and initialised when the computer is switched on.

; BIOS likes always to load 
; the boot sector to the address 0x7c00
; org directive tell the assembler 
; where you expect the code will be loaded in memory
; assembler will precalculate label address 
; by offset + this value when it is compiled
[org 0x7c00]

; This is the memory offset to which we will load our kernel
KERNEL_OFFSET equ 0x1000

; When the CPU runs in its intial 16-bit real mode,
; the maximum size of the registers is 16 bits,
; which means that the highest address 
; we can reference in an instruction is 0xffff (64 KB = 65536 bytes)
; the CPU designers added a few more special registers,
; cs, ds, ss, and es, called segment registers
; We can imagine main memory as being divided into segments 
; that are indexed by the segment registers
; the CPU will offset our address from 
; the segment register appropriate for the context of our instruction
; To calculate the absolute address the CPU multiplies the value 
; in the segment register by 16 and then adds your offset address

; >>>>>>>>>>> Bootsector padding and magic number <<<<<<<<<<
; When compiled, our program must fit into 512 bytes,

; so here, tell our assembly compiler to pad out our
; program with enough zero bytes (db 0) to bring us to the
; 510 th byte.
; $ is the address of the current position before emitting the bytes
; $$ evaluates to the beginning of the current section
; so ($âˆ’$$) tell you how far into the section
; db #value# just the byte #value# 
times 510 - ($ - $$) db 0

; Last two bytes ( one word ) make up the magic number,
; so BIOS knows we are a boot sector.
