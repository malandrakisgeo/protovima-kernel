    ; the modern processors use a technique called pipelining, 
    ; that allows them to process different stages 
    ; of an instruction’s execution in parallel
    ; each instruction might be fetched from memory,
    ; decoded into microcode instructions, executed, 
    ; then perhaps the result is stored back to memory; 
    ; and since these stages are semi-independent, 
    ; they could all be done within the same CPU cycle 
    ; but within different circuitry
    ; switching CPU modes is a risk that 
    ; the CPU may process some stages of 
    ; an instruction’s execution in the wrong mode
    ; So after instructing the CPU to switch mode, 
    ; is to force the CPU to finish any jobs in its pipeline,
    ;  that we can be confident that 
    ; all future instructions will be executed in the correct mode.
    ; pipelining doesn't like instruction such as jmp or call,
    ; because until those instructions have been executed fully 
    ; the CPU can have no idea about the instructions 
    ; that will follow them, especially if we use a far jump or call, 
    ; which means that we jump to another segment.
    ; So immediately after instructing the CPU to switch mode, 
    ; we can issue a far jump, which will force the CPU to flush the pipeline
    ; To issue a far jump, 
    ; we additionally provide the target segment


    ; Make a far jump ( i.e. to a new segment ) to our 32-bit code.
    ; This also forces the CPU to flush
    ; its cache of prefetched and real-mode decoded instructions,
    ; which can cause problems.

; 32-bit memory offsets are available, 
; so an offset can reference a whopping 4 GB of memory
; The CPU supports a more sophisticated and complex of memory segmentation
; Code in one segment can be prohibited from executing code in a more privilidged segment
; The CPU can implement virtual memory for user processes, 
; such that pages (i.e. fixed-sized chunks) of a process’s memory 
; can be swapped transparently between the disk and memory on an as-needed basis
; Interrupt handling is also more sophisticated
; we can no longer use BIOS once switched into 32-bit protected mode

; from that point onwards, it should encode in 32-bit mode instructions
